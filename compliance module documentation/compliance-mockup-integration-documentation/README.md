## Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture Approach: Full Migration

**Chosen Strategy**: Complete rewrite of compliance frontend from React 18 + Material-UI to Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Radix UI

**Rationale**:
- ‚úÖ Complete technology stack alignment with existing portals
- ‚úÖ Unified user experience across all customer touchpoints
- ‚úÖ Leverages existing authentication, state management, and testing infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Easier maintenance with consistent patterns and conventions
- ‚úÖ Better performance with Next.js App Router and server-side rendering

**Alternative Considered**: Micro-frontend integration was evaluated but rejected due to complexity and maintenance overhead.

### Backend Integration: API Extension Strategy

**Coverage Analysis**:
- **80% Existing APIs**: Leveraging comprehensive existing infrastructure
  - User management and authentication
  - Entity and customer service management
  - Document handling and storage
  - Notification and workflow systems
  - Payment processing and analytics

- **20% New Development**: Compliance-specific functionality
  - Government portal integrations
  - Compliance workflow management
  - Regulatory calendar and notifications
  - Compliance-specific reporting and analytics

### Technology Stack Alignment

| Component | Current Stack | Compliance Integration |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Frontend Framework** | Next.js 15 + TypeScript | ‚úÖ Same |
| **UI Components** | Radix UI + Tailwind CSS | ‚úÖ Same |
| **State Management** | Redux Toolkit + React Query | ‚úÖ Same |
| **Authentication** | NextAuth.js | ‚úÖ Extended |
| **Backend Framework** | Node.js + Express + MongoDB | ‚úÖ Same |
| **Testing** | Jest + Cypress + Playwright | ‚úÖ Same |
